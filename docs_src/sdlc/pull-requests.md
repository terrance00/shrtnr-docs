# Pull Requests

## Rules

- Before _pull requests_ will be eligible for review, a certain amount of processes will be ran:
    - PR branches will be compiled and must compile succesfully.
    - PR branches' unit tests will be run and must comile successfully.
    - At some point, we might include automation testing for the UI using something like [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress).

- PR's will need to reviewed by atleast two peers.

- Strict rules will apply for spelling and formatting - PR's with these errors will be declined.

- Any change to the PR branch will result in the above rules and processes running again.
