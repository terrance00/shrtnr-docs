# QA

## Cycle

Essentially by the time a sprint is completed. All features should be merged in to the __development__ branch. By the start of the QA cycle a deployed version of the system will exist based on the __pre-release__ branch.

- The QA cycle will commence after the previous sprint has completed.
- The release will be slated one sprint behind the previous sprint.

## Test Cases

Test cases should be documented and form part of a regression cycle.

The regression cycle should be run for every release.

_It would be a massive win if the regression test cases can systematically be automated to relieve the QA team._
