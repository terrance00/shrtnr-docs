# Bugs

## Pre-Release

Bugs found in the _pre-release_ phase by QA or any other process will take top priority so as not to delay the planned release.

## Hotfixes

Bugs that are absolutely critical will be fixed, tested and released immediately.

## Bugs into test cases

Bugs that are found by QA or in production will automatically be slated to form part of the collection of test cases.

Ideally we would want these test cases to be tested automatically, however at the very least they will be covered by regression tests.
