# Shrtnr API

This API will be consumed mainly by the [UI](./shrtnr-ui.md) that has been created.

However best practices should be kept in mind, and the API can be designed with __RESTFull__ principles.

_In the event a browser extension or mobile application wants to consume this API, it will easily be able to do so._

## Proposed Tech

A Restfull webAPI can easily be implemented by the following technologies:

- [.Net](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/)
    - Very simple to bootstrap.
    - Strongly typed.
    - Latest versions are extremely performant.
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) will be perfectly suited to this task.
    - Many developers know _javascript_.
    - Can have improved typing and stability by implementing _typescript_.
